Step 1: Get the first url from file - Task-1.txt say Task-1_url1

// Url present in both files is more important and must to add
Step 2: Check if Task-1_url1 is present in file Task-2
	if present, add the url to the new file 
		and remove from Task-1.txt and Task-3.txt
	else, repeat the step 1 for 1st url of file Task-3.txt
        	for checking if it is present in Task-1 file
Step 3: Repeat step 1 and 2 unless both files have all distinct urls
Step 4: Calculate remaining space in new file i.e 1000 - currentFileLength say, X

// Url present up the order are more important as they are from shallow pages
Step 5: Fetch first X/2 urls from both files
Step 6: Insert the urls in alternate fashion
	insert the first url from Task-1.txt
	followed by the first url of Task-3.txt

Step 7: Repeat the step 6 for remaining urls until 1000 urls are added to new file
